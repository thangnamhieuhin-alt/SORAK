// seeing a child whose identity shifted (because the children prop changed
// when RequireAuth flipped from loading-pass-through to the authed branch),
// the page entry animation would play multiple times in quick succession.
// The stable reference + direct animate values (no variants indirection)
// is the recommended pattern for Next.js App Router page transitions.
